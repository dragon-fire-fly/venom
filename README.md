# Love Venom
## Overview of project
‘Love Venom’ is a site that aims to provide accurate educational content about venom and animal poisons and the animals that produce them. This site will be useful for anyone who has an interest in venom, animal poison or animals in general and is intended for adults and children aged 12+.

<!-- Responsive mockup to go here -->

## UX
Love Venom was designed to provide a simple and easily navigatable website with a focus on large, high quality photos and accompanying text.
### User Stories
As a user, I would like to be able to:
- be able to learn about both vertebrate and invertebrate venomous animals
- read about a range of specific venomous animals
- access the Love Venom website from both desktop and mobile devices
- be able to access Love Venom from any browser of my choice
- be able to easily contact the site owner and sign up for a newsletter

### Colour Scheme
Various colour pallettes were explored in preparation for this project using https://coolors.co/ and https://mycolor.space/. An overall green theme was desired to be inkeeping with the venomous theme. A "matching gradient" pallette was chosen for the project. This pallette was generated by https://mycolor.space/ using colour #DDE7C7, a colour chosen from a https://coolors.co/ genetrated theme.
<!-- Insert final theme here once decided -->

### Typography
The following fonts were selected from Google Fonts:
- _Libre Baskerville Regular 400 Italic_ for the main "Love Venom" logo
- _Roboto Mono regular 300_ for the main page photo labels and nav bar
