## UX
Love Venom was designed to provide a simple and easily navigatable website with a focus on large, high quality photos and accompanying text.
### User Stories
As a user, I would like to be able to:
- be able to learn about both vertebrate and invertebrate venomous animals
- read about a range of specific venomous animals
- access the Love Venom website from both desktop and mobile devices
- be able to access Love Venom from any browser of my choice
- be able to easily contact the site owner and sign up for a newsletter

### Colour Scheme
Various colour pallettes were explored in preparation for this project using https://coolors.co/ and https://mycolor.space/. An overall green theme was desired to be inkeeping with the venomous theme. A "matching gradient" pallette was chosen for the project. This pallette was generated by https://mycolor.space/ using colour #DDE7C7, a colour chosen from a https://coolors.co/ genetrated theme.
<!-- Insert final theme here once decided -->

- _Libre Baskerville Regular 400 Italic_ for the main "Love Venom" logo
