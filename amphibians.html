            <h2>Amphibians</h2>
            <p>Amphibians are small vertebrates that need water, or a moist environment, to survive.
                The species in this group include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. All can breathe and absorb water
                through their very thin skin.
                Amphibians also have special skin glands that produce useful proteins. Some transport water, oxygen, and
                carbon dioxide either into or out of the animal. Others fight bacteria or fungal infections. To warn
                potential predators, the most toxic amphibians are also the most brightly coloured.</p>

                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong> The family Dendrobatidae currently contains 16 genera, with about 200

                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> native to tropical Central and South America</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Poisonous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> The golden poison frog is the most poisonous animal on the
                        planet; these frogs produce deadly alkaloid batrachotoxins in their skin glands as a defence
                        against predators. To become poisoned a predator generally must attempt to consume the frog,
                        although this species is so toxic that even touching an individual frog can be dangerous. </p>

                    <h3>Poison Dart Frogs continued</h3>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts ctd.:</strong>The frog is the main source of the poison in the darts
                        used by the natives to hunt their food. The
                        Ember√° people carefully expose the frog to the heat of a fire, and the frog exudes small amounts
                        of poisonous fluid. The tips of arrows and darts are soaked in the fluid, and remain deadly for
                        two
                        years or longer.
                        <p><strong>Captivity:</strong> Due to their small range in the wild, poaching for the pet trade
                            formerly represented a serious threat to the survival of the species. Due to efforts of frog
                            breeders like Tesoros de Colombia, captive bred frogs are now widely available for the pet
                            trade. As these specimens are legal, non-toxic, healthier, and less expensive when compared
                            to poached animals, the demand for
                            illegally obtained wild caught specimens has decreased. Today, the IUCN estimates that the
                            majority of golden poison frogs sold for the pet trade are legally produced from captive
                            lines, and estimates the threat from collection for the pet trade to be small.

                    <h3>Salamanders</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Rough-skinned Newt</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Salamandridae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Taricha (granulosa)</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Habitats of rough-skinned newts are found throughout the Pacific
                        Northwest. Their range extends south to Santa Cruz, California, and north to Alaska</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Poisonous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Some salamander toxins are particularly potent including the
                        neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, the most toxic nonprotein substance known. It is the same toxin found
                        in pufferfish and a number of other marine animals and has the effect of inducing paralysis and
                        death by asphyxiation. Handling the newts does no harm, but ingestion of even a minute fragment
                        of skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds, and mammals were all found
                        to be susceptible.</p>

                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Common toad</p>

                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Bufo</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> most of Europe, in the western part of North Asia, and in a small
                        portion of Northwest Africa</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Poisonous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> The main toxic substance found in the parotoid gland and skin
                        of the common toad is called bufotoxin. Its physical effects resemble those of digitalis, which
                        in small doses increases the strength with which the heart muscle contracts and which is used in
                        the treatment of congestive heart failure. The skin of the cane toad contains enough toxin to
                        cause serious symptoms or even death in animals, including humans. Clinical effects include
                        severe irritation and pain to eyes, mouth, nose and throat, cardiovascular and respiratory
                        symptoms, paralysis and seizures, increased salivation, vomiting, hyperkalemia, cyanosis and
                        hallucinations. There is no known anti-venom.</p>
