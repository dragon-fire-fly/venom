            <h2>Fish</h2>
            <p>There are thought to be up to 3,000 different venomous fish species with approximately 18 independent
                incidences of venom evolution (4 times in cartilaginous fishes, once in eels, once in catfishes and 12
                times in spiny-rayed fishes). The most common method for envenomation is via dorsal spines (95% venomous
                fish species, 15 independent evolution events), venomous fangs (2% species, 2 independent evolution
                events) or and opercular or subopercular spines (1% species, 3 independent evolution events).
                Fish venoms possess cardiovascular, neuromuscular, oedematic and cytolytic activity. Lethal toxins have
                been isolated and purified, with some having toxicity values comparable to that of snake venoms.
                In contrast to reptile species, fish venoms are relatively unstudied and the thousands of unique venoms
                they produce therefore represent an untapped resource of potentially active pharmacological agents.
                Poisonous fish are fish that are poisonous to eat. They contain toxins which are not destroyed by the
                digestive systems of animals that eat the fish.

                    <h3>Stonefish</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Stone Fish</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Scorpaenidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Synanceia</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. Red sea, Persian Gulf,
                        northern Indian Ocean, Australia</p>
                    <p><strong>First documented:</strong> 1766 (Scorpaena horrida discovered by Carl Linnaeus)</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> The species has potent neurotoxins secreted from glands at
                        the base of their needle-like dorsal fin spines
                        which stick up when disturbed or threatened. Stonefish have the ability to extend a sharp,
                        specialized spine known as a lachrymal sabre
                        as an additional defence mechanism. The venom of Synanceia is potent and can result in cellular
                        deterioration of the afflicted organism due
                        to toxins that target cellular membranes.</p>
                    <p><strong>As food:</strong> Synanceia is edible to humans if properly prepared. The protein-based
                        venom quickly breaks down when heated, and raw stonefish served as part of sashimi is rendered
                        harmless simply by removing the dorsal fins which are the
                        main source of venom. The fish are considered a delicacy in many parts of Asia, including south
                        Japan, south Fujian, Guangdong in China, and
                        Hong Kong. In the Hokkien-speaking area, they are considered delicacies and good for health. The
                        meat of Synanceia is white, dense and sweet,
                        and the skin is also edible. They are usually cooked with ginger into a clear soup, and
                        sometimes served raw as sashimi.</p>

                    <h3>Stingrays</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Stingray</p>
                    <p><strong>Suborder:</strong><em> Myliobatoidei</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Hexatrygonidae, Plesiobatidae, Urolophidae, Urotrygonidae,
                            Dasyatidae, Potamotrygonidae, Gymnuridae, Myliobatidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine
                        waters throughout the world but are also found in warmer temperate oceans, the deep ocean and
                        even freshwater rivers. There are about 220 known
                        stingray species organized into ten families and 29 genera. As of 2013, 45 species have been
                        listed as vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN.</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Micronesia and other related regions made spear- and
                        arrow-heads from stingray stingers. Whips were also crafted
                        from large stingray tails in the Horn of Africa. The skin of the ray is used as an under layer
                        for the cord or leather wrap (known as samegawa in
                        Japanese) on Japanese swords due to its hard, rough texture that keeps the braided wrap from
                        sliding on the handle during use.</p>
                    <p><strong>As food:</strong> Rays are edible and may be caught as food using fishing lines or
                        spears.
                        Stingray recipes can be found in many coastal areas
                        worldwide. For example, in Malaysia and Singapore, stingray is commonly grilled over charcoal,
                        then served with spicy sambal sauce. In Goa, and
                        other Indian states, it is sometimes used as part of spicy curries. Generally, the most prized
                        parts of the stingray are the wings, the "cheek"
                        (the area surrounding the eyes), and the liver. The rest of the ray is considered too rubbery to
                        have any culinary uses.</p>

                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Pufferfish</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Tetraodontidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong> The Tetraodontidae contain 193 species of puffers in 28 genera. The full
                        list may be found

                            aria-label="a link to the wikipedia article on pufferfish genera">
                            here</a></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> They are most diverse in the tropics, relatively uncommon in the
                        temperate zone, and completely absent from cold waters </p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Poisonous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> As a defence, pufferfish can fill their extremely elastic
                        stomach with water (or air if not in water), making them
                        inflate into a ball shape which is much larger than their original size. Combined with their
                        pointed spines, this helps to deter predators, or cause
                        them to choke. Predators who successfully swallow pufferfish may find their stomachs full of
                        tetrodotoxin (TTX), making puffers an unpleasant,
                        possibly lethal, choice of prey. This neurotoxin is found primarily in the ovaries and liver,
                        although smaller amounts exist in the intestines and
                        skin, as well as trace amounts in muscle. It does not always have a lethal effect on large
                        predators, such as sharks, but it can kill humans.</p>
                    <p>Dolphins have been filmed expertly handling pufferfish amongst themselves in an apparent attempt
                        to get intoxicated or enter a trance-like state.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>As food:</strong> Despite the high concentration of toxins found in pufferfish organs,
                        the meat of some species is considered a delicacy in Japan (as 河豚, pronounced fugu), Korea (as
                        복, bok, or 복어, bogeo), and China (as 河豚, hétún) when prepared by specially trained chefs who
                        know which part is safe to eat and in what quantity. Other pufferfish species with nontoxic
                        flesh are considered a delicacy elsewhere.</p>

                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Lionfish, firefish, turkeyfish, tastyfish, butterfly-cod</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Scorpaenidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Pterois</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> The lionfish is native to subtropical and tropical regions
                        from southern Japan and southern Korea to the east coast of Australia, Indonesia, Micronesia,
                        French Polynesia, and the South Pacific Ocean. </p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> The lionfish is a predator native to the Indo-Pacific. It
                        aggressively preys on small fish and invertebrates, which severely threatens the natural
                        competition of aquatic life in the ocean. The red lionfish (P. volitans) and the common
                        lionfish (P. miles), have established themselves as significant invasive species off the East
                        Coast of the United States and in the Caribbean. They have been described as "one of the most
                        aggressively invasive species on the planet" </p>
                    <p><strong>As food:</strong> When properly filleted, the naturally venomous fish is safe to eat.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2010, NOAA began the "Lionfish as Food" campaign to encourage the consumption of the fish as
                        human hunting of the fish as the only form of control known to date. Increasing the catch of
                        lionfish could not only help maintain a reasonable population density, but also provide an
                        alternative fishing source to overfished populations, such as grouper and snapper. The taste is
                        described as "buttery and tender". Cooking techniques and preparations for lionfish include
                        deep-frying, ceviche, jerky, grilling, and sashimi.
