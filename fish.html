            <h2>Fish</h2>
            <p>There are thought to be up to 3,000 different venomous fish species with approximately 18 independent
                incidences of venom evolution (4 times in cartilaginous fishes, once in eels, once in catfishes and 12
                times in spiny-rayed fishes). The most common method for envenomation is via dorsal spines (95% venomous
                fish species, 15 independent evolution events), venomous fangs (2% species, 2 independent evolution
                events) or and opercular or subopercular spines (1% species, 3 independent evolution events).
                Fish venoms possess cardiovascular, neuromuscular, oedematic and cytolytic activity. Lethal toxins have
                been isolated and purified, with some having toxicity values comparable to that of snake venoms.
                In contrast to reptile species, fish venoms are relatively unstudied and the thousands of unique venoms
                they produce therefore represent an untapped resource of potentially active pharmacological agents.
                Poisonous fish are fish that are poisonous to eat. They contain toxins which are not destroyed by the
                digestive systems of animals that eat the fish.

                    <h3>Stonefish</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Stone Fish</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Scorpaenidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Synanceia</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. Red sea, Persian Gulf,
                        northern Indian Ocean, Australia</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> The species has potent neurotoxins secreted from glands
                        at the base of their needle-like dorsal fin spines
                        which stick up when disturbed or threatened. Stonefish have the ability to extend a sharp,
                        specialized spine known as a lachrymal sabre
                        as an additional defence mechanism. </p>
                    <p><strong>As food:</strong> Synanceia is edible to humans if properly prepared. The
                        protein-based
                        venom quickly breaks down when heated, and raw stonefish served as part of sashimi is
                        rendered
                        harmless simply by removing the dorsal fins which are the
                        main source of venom. The fish are considered a delicacy in many parts of Asia.</p>

                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Stingray</p>
                    <p><strong>Suborder:</strong><em> Myliobatoidei</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong> There are about 220 species organized into ten families (<em>
                            Hexatrygonidae, Plesiobatidae, Urolophidae, Urotrygonidae,
                            Dasyatidae, Potamotrygonidae, Gymnuridae, Myliobatidae</em>) and 29 genera.</p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine
                        waters throughout the world but are also found in warmer temperate oceans, the deep ocean and
                        even freshwater rivers. </p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Micronesia and other related regions made spear- and
                        arrow-heads from stingray stingers. Whips were also crafted
                        from large stingray tails in the Horn of Africa. The skin of the ray is used as an under layer
                        for the cord or leather wrap on Japanese swords.</p>
                    <p><strong>As food:</strong> Stingrays are edible and recipes can be found in many coastal areas
                        worldwide. In Malaysia and Singapore, stingray is commonly grilled over charcoal,
                        then served with spicy sambal sauce. In Goa, and
                        other Indian states, it is sometimes used as part of spicy curries. Generally, the most prized
                        parts of the stingray are the wings, the "cheek" and the liver. The rest is too
                        rubbery to
                        have any culinary uses.</p>

                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Pufferfish</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Tetraodontidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong> The Tetraodontidae contain 193 species of puffers in 28 genera. Full

                            here</a></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> They are most diverse in the tropics, relatively uncommon in the
                        temperate zone, and completely absent from cold waters </p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Poisonous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Pufferfish can fill their extremely elastic
                        stomach with water (or air if not in water),
                        inflating them into a large ball shape. Combined with their
                        pointed spines, this helps to deter predators, or cause
                        choking. Predators who successfully swallow pufferfish may find their stomachs full of the
                        neurotoxin
                        tetrodotoxin (TTX). It is not always lethal to large
                        predators such as sharks, but it can kill humans. Dolphins have been filmed passing pufferfish
                        amongst themselves in an apparent attempt
                        to get intoxicated.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>As food:</strong> Despite the high concentration of toxins found in pufferfish organs,
                        the meat of some species is considered a delicacy in Japan, Korea and China when prepared by
                        specially trained chefs who
                        know which part is safe to eat and in what quantity. Other pufferfish species with nontoxic
                        flesh are considered a delicacy elsewhere.</p>

                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Lionfish, firefish, turkeyfish, tastyfish, butterfly-cod</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Scorpaenidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Pterois</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> The lionfish is native to subtropical and tropical regions
                        from southern Japan and southern Korea to the east coast of Australia, Indonesia, Micronesia,
                        French Polynesia, and the South Pacific Ocean. </p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> The lionfish aggressively preys on small fish and
                        invertebrates, which severely threatens the natural
                        competition of aquatic life in the ocean. The red lionfish (P. volitans) and the common
                        lionfish (P. miles), have established themselves as significant invasive species off the East
                        Coast of the United States and in the Caribbean. They have been described as "one of the most
                        aggressively invasive species on the planet" </p>
                    <p><strong>As food:</strong> When properly filleted, the naturally venomous fish is safe to eat.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2010, NOAA began the "Lionfish as Food" campaign to encourage the consumption of the fish as
                        human hunting of the fish is the only form of control known to date. Increasing the catch of
                        lionfish could not only help maintain a reasonable population density, but also provide an
                        alternative fishing source to overfished populations, such as grouper and snapper. The taste is
                        described as "buttery and tender". Cooking techniques and preparations for lionfish include
                        deep-frying, ceviche, jerky, grilling, and sashimi.
