            <h2>Insects and Other Arthropods</h2>
            <p>Arthropods are invertebrates with segmented bodies and jointed limbs. The exoskeleton or cuticles
                consists of chitin, a polymer of glucosamine. Estimates of the number of arthropod species vary between
                1,170,000 and 5 to 10 million and account for over 80 percent of all known living animal species. This
                section focuses on some of the most common and well known venomous (or poisonous) arthropods.</p>

                    <h3>Bees</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Bee</p>
                    <p><strong>Order:</strong><em> Hymenoptera</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Superfamily:</strong><em> Apoidea</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Bees are found on every continent except for Antarctica, in every
                        habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> The main component of bee venom responsible for pain in
                        vertebrates is the toxin melittin. Histamine and other biogenic amines may also contribute to
                        pain and itching. With a toxic sting, and thus the ability to protect against predators,
                        Hymenoptera were able to progress towards sociality and its associated evolutionary benefits of
                        the shared raising of youth, individual task specialization, inter-colony communication, and
                        food storage.

                    <h3>Ants</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Ant</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Formicidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Subfamilies:</strong><em> Formicidae is divided into 21 subfamilies with more than 12,000
                            described species and many others awaiting description.</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Ants have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only
                        places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> The bullet ant's sting is currently the highest on Schmidt's
                        sting pain index, at 4.0+. The pain has been described as “walking over flaming charcoal with a
                        three-inch nail embedded in your heel". Some victims compared the pain to that of being shot,
                        hence the name of the insect. It is described as causing "waves of burning, throbbing,
                        all-consuming pain that continues unabated for up to 24 hours". The Sateré-Mawé people of Brazil
                        use intentional bullet ant stings as part of their initiation rites to become warriors. 80
                        bullet ants are woven into gloves made of leaves, stingers facing inward, and initiee must keep
                        the glove on for 5 to 10 minutes. When finished, the boy's hand and part of his arm are
                        temporarily paralyzed because of the ant venom, and he may shake uncontrollably for days.

                    <h3>Beetles</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Beetle (here White-Eyed Assassin Bug)</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Reduviidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Platymeris</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Endemic to tropical Africa, it is found in countries such as
                        Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia,
                        Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and
                        Mozambique in humid tropical forest, particularly hollow tree stumps and decaying logs</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> White-eyed Assassin Bugs have needle like mouth parts
                        designed for sucking juices out of plants or other insects instead of chewing. <em>P.
                            biguttatus</em> has sharp stylets in its proboscis or rostrum used to pierce the exoskeleton
                        of its prey. Saliva is then injected into the prey which liquifies its tissues, and the rostrum
                        is then used to suck out the digested fluids. If disturbed, it is capable of a defensive bite
                        considered to be more painful than a bee sting. It is also known to spit venom that can cause
                        temporary blindness in humans.</p>

                    <h3>Centipedes</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Centipede</p>
                    <p><strong>Class:</strong><em> Chilopoda</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Orders:</strong><em> Scutigeromorpha, Lithobiomorpha, Craterostigmomorpha,
                            Scolopendromorpha and Geophilomorpha</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Centipedes have a wide geographical range, even reaching beyond
                        the Arctic Circle. They are found in an array of terrestrial habitats from tropical rainforests
                        to deserts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> While a bite to an adult human is usually very painful and
                        may cause severe swelling, chills, fever, and weakness, it is unlikely to be fatal. Bites can be
                        dangerous to small children and those with allergies to bee stings. The venomous bite of larger
                        centipedes can induce anaphylactic shock in such people. Smaller centipedes are generally
                        incapable of piercing human skin.
                        As a food item, certain large-sized centipedes are consumed in China, usually skewered and
                        grilled or deep fried.
