            <h2>Mammals and Birds</h2>
            <p>Members from four orders of mammals, Eulipotyphla (e.g. shrews), Monotremata (e.g. porcupines or
                playpus), Chiroptera (e.g. bats) and Primates (e.g. Slow loris) utilise venom for defence. It is
                suggested that modern mammalian predators do not need venom because they are able to kill quickly with
                their teeth or claws, whereas venom, no matter how sophisticated, requires time to disable prey.
                No species of bird is known to actively inject or produce venom, but the discovered toxic birds are
                known to be poisonous to touch and eat.

                    <h3>Shrews</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Shrew</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Soricidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Crocidurinae, Myosoricinae, Soricinae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Almost worldwide - only New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand
                        have no native shrews</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Toxins:</strong> Shrew venom is not conducted into the wound by fangs, but by grooves in
                        the teeth. The venom contains various compounds, and the contents of the venom glands of the
                        American short-tailed shrew are sufficient to kill 200 mice by intravenous injection. One
                        chemical extracted from shrew venom may be potentially useful in the treatment of high blood
                        pressure, while another compound may be useful in the treatment of some neuromuscular diseases
                        and migraines.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> The saliva of the northern short-tailed shrew (<em>Blarina
                            brevicauda</em>) contains soricidin, a peptide which has been studied for use in treating
                        ovarian cancer. Also, along with the bats and toothed whales, some species of shrews use
                        echolocation.</p>

                    <h3>Slow Loris</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Slow Loris</p>
                    <p><strong>Subfamily:</strong><em> Lorinae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Nycticebus</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Slow lorises are found in South and Southeast Asia</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Toxins:</strong> Slow lorises produce a secretion from their brachial gland (a scent
                        gland on the upper arm near the axilla) that is licked and mixed with their saliva when
                        threatened. They then bite their aggressors, delivering the toxin into the wounds.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> The two greatest threats to slow lorises are deforestation
                        and the wildlife trade. Slow lorises are sold locally at street markets and despite being
                        illegal as pets in most countries, internationally over the Internet and in pet stores.
                        In addition, traditional medicine made from loris parts is
                        thought to cure many diseases and is still in high demand.</p>

                    <h3>Vampire Bats</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Vampire Bat</p>
                    <p><strong>Subfamily:</strong><em> Desmodontinae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genera:</strong><em> Desmodus, Diphylla, Diaemus</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Central to South America in colonies in caves, old wells, hollow
                        trees and buildings. </p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Toxins:</strong> Vampire bats produce toxic saliva with anticoagulant properties that
                        allow nourishment on blood alone. Most of their prey do not perish from
                        contact with the venom. Hematophagy (feeding on blood) probably evolved
                        only once, and the members from the three genera share this common ancestor.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> A vampire bat can only survive about two days without
                        feeding, yet they cannot be guaranteed of finding food every night. They can regurgitate a small
                        amount of blood in order to sustain another colony member and bats may “beg” other colony
                        members for blood when starving.</p>

                    <h3>Pitohuis</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Hooded Pitohui</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Oriolidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Pitohui</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Endemic to the islands of New Guinea</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Poisonous</p>
                    <p><strong>Toxins:</strong> The feathers, skin and tissues of the hooded pitohui and some related
                        birds contain a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin. This toxin
                        is the same toxin found in some poison dart frogs.
                        They are not thought to create the toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from
                        their diet, most likely from <em>Choresine</em> beetles which contain the toxin and have been
                        found in the stomachs of hooded pitohui.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Some other non-toxic birds, such as the juvenile greater
                        melampitta, have been known to mimic the plumage of the hooded pitohui or other toxic birds in
                        an attempt to avoid predation.</p>
