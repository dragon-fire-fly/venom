                    <h3>Black Widow Spider</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Black Widow Spider</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Theridiidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Latrodectus</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Widow spiders are found on every continent of the world except
                        Antarctica</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Widow spiders have a red or orange hourglass shape on the
                        underside of the abdomen. These small spiders have an unusually potent venom containing the
                        neurotoxin latrotoxin, which causes the condition latrodectism, both named after the genus.
                        Female widow spiders have unusually large venom glands, and their bite can be particularly
                        harmful to large vertebrates, including humans. Only the bites of the females are dangerous to
                        humans. Despite their notoriety, <em>Latrodectus</em> bites rarely cause death or produce
                        serious complications.
                        They are often confused with spiders in the genus <em>Steatoda</em>, known as false widow
                        spiders, due to their similar appearance.

                    <h3>Brown Recluse Spiders</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Brown Recluse Spider</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Sicariidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Loxosceles</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> North America – Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Texas
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> While the majority of brown recluse spider bites do not
                        result in any symptoms, occasionally necrotizing ulcers as the result of soft tissue destruction
                        occur and may take months to heal, leaving deep scars. These bites usually become painful and
                        itchy within 2 to 8 hours. Pain and other local effects worsen 12 to 36 hours after the bite,
                        and the necrosis develops over the next few days. Over time, the wound may grow to as large as
                        25 cm. The damaged tissue becomes gangrenous and eventually sloughs away.</p>

                    <h3>Jumping Spiders</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Jumping Spider</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Salticidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Onomastinae, Asemoneinae, Lyssomaninae, Spartaeinae, Eupoinae,
                            Hisponinae, Salticinae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Tropical forests harbor the most species, but they are also found
                        in temperate forests, scrubland, deserts, intertidal zones, and mountainous regions</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Jumping spiders have four pairs of eyes; three secondary
                        pairs that are fixed and a principal pair that is movable. Their well-developed internal
                        hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering the pressure of their body fluid (hemolymph)
                        within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular legs like a
                        grasshopper. Most jumping spiders can jump several times the length of their bodies. When a
                        jumping spider is moving from place to place, and especially just before it jumps, it tethers a
                        filament of silk (or 'dragline') to whatever it is standing on to protect itself if the jump
                        should fail.</p>

                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Tarantula</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Theraphosidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula#Genera">148
                                genera</a>, 1,236 species </em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Central America and throughout South America, Africa, much of Asia
                        and all of Australia. In Europe, some species occur in Spain, Portugal, Turkey, southern Italy,
                        and Cyprus.</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> All tarantulas are venomous. Although their venom is not
                        deadly to humans, some bites cause serious discomfort that might persist for several days. In
                        general, the effects of the bites of all kinds of tarantula are not well known. While the bites
                        of many species are known to be no worse than a wasp sting, accounts of bites by some species
                        are reported to be very painful and to produce intense spasms that may recur over a period of
                        several days; the venom of the African tarantula <em>Pelinobius muticus</em> also causes strong
                        hallucinations.
                        Most New-world tarantulas—those indigenous to the Americas - are equipped with urticating hairs
                        on their abdomens which they can “flick” at predators as a defence mechanism. These hairs are
                        barbed and may cause itching and rashes and may penetrate the cornea, if exposed.
