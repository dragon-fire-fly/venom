            <h2>Reptiles</h2>
            <p>Some 450 species of snake are venomous. Snake venom is produced by glands below the eye (the mandibular
                glands) and delivered to the target through tubular or channelled fangs. Snake venoms contain a variety
                of peptide toxins, including proteases, which hydrolyse protein peptide bonds; nucleases, which
                hydrolyse the phosphodiester bonds of DNA; and neurotoxins, which disrupt signalling in the nervous
                system. Snake venom causes symptoms including pain, swelling, tissue necrosis, low blood pressure,
                convulsions, haemorrhage (varying by species of snake), respiratory paralysis, kidney failure, coma, and
                death. Snake venom may have originated with duplication of genes that had been expressed in the salivary
                glands of ancestors.
                Venom is found in a few other reptiles such as the Mexican Beaded Lizard, the Gila Monster and some
                monitor lizards, including the Komodo Dragon. Mass spectrometry showed that the mixture of proteins
                present in their venom is as complex as the mixture of proteins found in snake venom.

                    <h3>Cobras</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Cobra</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Elapidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Naja</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Regions throughout Africa, Southwest Asia, South Asia, and
                        Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Venom:</strong> All of the known cobras are venomous and many are capable of rearing
                        upwards and producing a hood when threatened. All true cobras are capable of delivering a fatal
                        bite to a human. Most species have strongly neurotoxic venom, which attacks the nervous system,
                        causing paralysis, but many also have cytotoxic features which cause swelling and necrosis, and
                        have a significant anticoagulant effect. Some also have cardiotoxic components to their venom.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Several species have evolved the ability to “spit” venom
                        which can cause a burning sensation if it enters the eye and even lead to blindness if not
                        washed immediately and thoroughly.
                        The “King Cobra” is in fact not a cobra but rather belongs to the genus Ophiophagus.

                    <h3>Vipers</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Viper</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Viperidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Subfamilies:</strong><em> Azemiopinae (Fea's vipers), Causinae (Night Adders), Crotalinae
                            (Pit Vipers), Viperinae (True Vipers)</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Vipers are found in the Americas, Africa, Eurasia, and South Asia.
                       In Europe, Asia and Africa, vipers are found everywhere except Siberia,
                        Ireland, Norway and Sweden.</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Venom:</strong> Viperid venoms typically contain an abundance of protein-degrading
                        enzymes called proteases which produce symptoms such as pain, local swelling and necrosis, blood
                        loss and disruption of the blood-clotting system. Viper venom may also cause damage to blood
                        vessels and haemolysis. Death is usually caused by collapse in blood pressure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Captopril was the first ever ACE Inhibitor, a class of drugs
                        used for treating high blood pressure and congestive heart failure, and is an analogue of a
                        peptide found in the venom of the viper <em>Bothrops jararaca.</em></p>

                    <h3>Heloderma Lizards</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Mexican beaded lizard (<em>Heloderma horridum</em>) or Gila
                        monster (<em>Heloderma suspectum</em>)</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Helodermatidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Heloderma</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> America, Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Venom:</strong> Although the Gila monster's bite is normally not fatal to healthy adult
                        humans, it is generally regarded as the most painful venom produced by any vertebrate. Its venom
                        may cause haemorrhage, lethargy, partial paralysis of the limbs or hypothermia.
                        The beaded lizard's venom is a weak hemotoxin, and although human deaths are rare, it can cause
                        respiratory failure. Almost all documented human bites (eight in the past century) have resulted
                        from prodding captive lizards with a finger or bare foot.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Exenatide (marketed as Byetta), used in the management of
                        Type-2 diabetes, is a synthetic drug designed from the protein exendin-4, isolated from the Gila
                        monster's venom. Venom from both Gila Monster and Beaded Lizard venom have shown an inhibitory
                        effect in lung cancer.</p>

                    <h3>Rattlesnakes</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Rattlesnake</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Crotalinae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Genus:</strong><em> Crotalus and Sistrurus</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia through
                        Ontario in southern Canada, to central Argentina.</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Venom:</strong> Rattlesnake venom is hemotoxic, destroying tissue, causing necrosis and
                        coagulopathy (disrupted blood clotting) and may lead to paralysis. Common symptoms include
                        swelling, severe pain, tingling, weakness, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, hemorrhaging,
                        perspiration, and (rarely) heart failure.
                        Rattlesnakes are the leading contributor to snakebite injuries in North America, but rarely bite
                        unless provoked or threatened; if treated promptly, the bites are seldom fatal.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Rattlesnakes receive their name from the rattle located at
                        the end of their tails, which makes a loud rattling noise when vibrated that deters predators or
                        serves as a warning to passers-by.</p>
