            <h2>Scorpions</h2>
            <p>Scorpions are predatory arachnids of the order Scorpiones. They have eight legs, and are easily
                recognized by a pair of grasping pincers and a narrow, segmented tail, often carried in a characteristic
                forward curve over the back and always ending with a stinger.
                They mainly live in deserts but have adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, and can be
                found on all continents except Antarctica. All known species give live birth and the female cares for
                the young as their exoskeletons harden, transporting them on her back.
                The vast majority of species do not seriously threaten humans, and healthy adults usually do not need
                medical treatment after a sting. About 25 species (fewer than one percent) have venom capable of killing
                a human, which happens frequently in the parts of the world where they live, primarily where access to
                medical treatment is unlikely.

                    <h3>Scorpions</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Scorpion</p>
                    <p><strong>Taxonomy:</strong>There are currently twenty-two families containing over 2,500
                            species of scorpions organised within the following “Superfamilies”: <em>Pseudochactoidea,
                            Buthoidea, Chaeriloidea, Chactoidea, Iuroidea and Scorpionoidea</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Scorpions are found on all continents except Antarctica. Scorpions
                        did not occur naturally in Great Britain, New Zealand and some of the islands in Oceania, but
                        have now been accidentally introduced into these places by humans.</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Generally speaking, the venom potency and potential danger
                        posed to humans can be estimated by the ratio between the size of the pincers at the front and
                        the thickness of the tail at the back. This shows whether the scorpion generally hunts using its
                        strength (size of pincers) or venom (thickness of tail). The first scorpions were taxonomically identified in 1758 by
                        Carl Linnaeus, the “father of modern taxonomy”.</p>

                    <h3>Buthid Scorpions</h3>
                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Buthid scorpion, Fat-tail scorpion, Bark scorpion</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong><em> Buthidae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Subfamilies:</strong><em> Buthinae, Centrurinae, Isometrinae, Tityinae</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> They occur in the warmer parts of every major landmass on Earth,
                        except on New Zealand</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> Venomous</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Scorpions from the genera <em>Androctonus, Centruroides,
                        Hottentotta, Leiurus, Parabuthus</em>, and <em>Tityus</em> are notorious for their strong venom. Human
                        fatalities have been recorded from fewer than two dozen species. Studied Buthidae toxins have
                        been found to hyperpolarize nerves and slow inactivation, causing painful nerve firing that can
                        last for hours.
                        Some notoriously dangerous scorpions include <em> Leiurus quinquestriatus</em> (“Deathstalker”) and
                        <em>Androctonus</em>, which translates in English to “Man-killer”.
                        Despite the risks of keeping such potentially dangerous venomous species in captivity, Buthid
                        scorpions are frequently found in the exotic pet trade, although many countries require a
                        licence to keep them.

                    <h3>Scorpions and UV light</h3>
                    Scorpions glow a vibrant blue-green when exposed to certain wavelengths ranges of ultraviolet light
                    such as that produced by a black light, due to fluorescent chemicals such as beta-carboline in the
                    cuticle. Accordingly, a hand-held ultraviolet lamp has long been a standard tool for nocturnal field
                    surveys of these animals. Fluorescence occurs as a result of sclerotization and increases in
                    intensity with each successive instar. This fluorescence may have an active role in the scorpion's
                    ability to detect light.

                    <p><strong> Common name:</strong> Vinegeroon</p>

                    <p><strong>Subfamilies:</strong><em> Hypoctoninae, Mastigoproctinae, Thelyphoninae, Typopeltinae,
                            incertae sedis</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Tropical and subtropical areas excluding Europe and Australia</p>
                    <p><strong>Venomous or poisonous?:</strong> N/a</p>
                    <p><strong>Interesting facts:</strong> Vinegeroons are not true scorpions but rather “whip
                        scorpions”, so called due to their similarity in appearance to real scorpions but with a long,
                        thin, “whip-like” tail. When attacked, Vinegeroons discharge an offensive, vinegar-smelling
                        liquid, which contains acetic acid.</p>
